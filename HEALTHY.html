                What’s in the fruit diet?
              
              </h1>
              <h5 style="text-align: left;">
              <p>The fruitarian, or fruit, diet is a highly restrictive vegan diet. It excludes all animal products, including dairy. People following this program eat a diet consisting primarily of raw fruits.</p>
            <p>Vegetables, dried fruits, nuts, and seeds can also be eaten in moderation.</p>
          <p>
            There isn’t one specific way to do the fruit diet. Some fruitarians only eat fruit that has fallen onto the ground, rather than fruits that have been picked. Others won’t eat any seeds, because these have the capacity to become living plants.

            What are the potential benefits?
            </h1>

            <h5 style="text-align: left;">
            <p>When eaten in moderation, fruit can be a very healthy part of a nutritious diet. Some benefits from eating fruit include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fruits contain fiber, which can help lower your cholesterol and encourage regular bowel movements. Apples, pears, blackberries, and raspberries are examples of fruits high in dietary fiber.</li>
              <li>Oranges, red peppers, and strawberries are examples of fruits that contain lots of vitamin C. This helps keep teeth and gums healthy. Vitamin C also supports the immune system.</li>
              <li>Bananas, guavas, cantaloupe, and mangos are examples of fruits higher in potassium. Potassium can help maintain a healthy blood pressure and regulate fluid balance in the body.</li>

          <h2>The Top 6 Healthiest Beverages</h2>
          <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Water</li>
            <p>Hydrating the body early in the morning helps beat that tired feeling and make your skin glow its best! </p>
            <p>In a recent study at the University of East London, more than half of schoolchildren tested were in a state of mild dehydration at the beginning of the school day. Testing of the children measured cognitive performance, and then they were given glasses of water and retested. In nearly every measure, including happiness, visual attention, and visual search, their scores increased.

              Similar studies with both children and adults have confirmed the findings that proper hydration is essential for cognitive performance and mental health.</p>
              <p>If you’re a soda addict and are having difficulty switching to water, try sparkling water. A Soda Stream™ machine is more eco-friendly and more affordable in the long term than buying bottled sparkling water. Plus, carbonated water may relieve dyspepsia (pain, bloating and nausea) as well as constipation.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Green Tea</li>
            <p>It is a sip at lunch drink. Green kick-starts metabolism and can help fend off breast cancer.</p>
            <p>Green tea may be one of the best beverages for cancer prevention, but did you know that green tea has also been found to improve artery function, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease?</p>
            <p>Our blood vessels are lined with the endothelium – a thin, protective lining of cells. The endothelial cells produce a gas called nitric oxide which helps our blood flow smoothly. These precious cells only live for about 30 years. As these cells die and get replaced, people in their 40s and 50s often experience a decline in endothelial function. This decline in endothelial function is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and more.</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Coffee</li>
            <p>At Breakfast Coffee helps your heart and (if you take it black) metabolism, and it reduces risk for some types of cancer.</p>
            <p>Coffee has long been a controversial beverage when it comes to our health, but recent evidence suggests that the world’s favorite way to wake up may have caught an unnecessarily bad rap.</p>
            <p>Of course, what’s done to coffee has a significant impact on how healthy it actually is for you. Many coffee shops add sugar, milk, artificial flavorings, high fructose corn syrup, and other chemicals that can more than cancel out the health benefits of the coffee itself.</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Hot Cocoa</li>
            <p>It has more antioxidants than coffee, red wine or green tea. Great for your heart and skin; works best when snacked up.</p>
            <p>There are studies and researches which show that hot cocoa can boost the mood of a person. The health benefits of drinking hot cocoa include fighting stress, anxiety and depression. Endorphins, the chemical responsible for elevaion of mood, are secreted when you have this drink, which helps in improving your mood</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Water with Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <p>A glass of water with the addition of apple cider vinegar is a folk remedy used for many ailments.

              Recent studies have confirmed that consuming vinegar with a meal reduces the spike in blood sugar, insulin, and triglycerides. It also increases satiety – the feeling of being full after a meal</p>
              <p>*Note: Don’t drink vinegar straight. The acetic acid in vinegar can burn your esophagus.</p>

              <li style="font-weight: bold;">Milk</li>
              <p>Grab it before going to bed— your skeleton will love the calcium, and your muscles will love the protein. You’ll wake up even stronger!</p>
              <p>There are too many benifits of milk Strong Bones, Source of Vitamins and Minerals,  Relaxer, Protein Rich,  Weight Loss, Reduce The Appearance of Dark Circles, Soothes Heartburn, Helps Promote Healthy Skin, Source of Healthy Fats, Helps Hydrate Your Body.</p>
